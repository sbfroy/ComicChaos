TODO: If I request something that isn't allowed by OpenAI (e.g. Spiderman), the comic crashes.

TODO: Users should be able to create a comic or look at comics already generated (if API wallet empty). I need to make a save button (if the suer wants to save, then prompt them for a name and mention that their comic will be displayed online). Also when create new comic button is pressed it should go to the main page not the loading screen.

TODO: Should include buddys description in every panel, because it sometimes makes him into something else (e.g. a human).

TODO: Need to fix narration boxes parameters. They are currently very small and never seen by the algorithm.

TODO: Clean up generation page to display bigger panels.
