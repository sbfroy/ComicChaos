USER'S INPUT FROM PREVIOUS PANEL: {user_input}

The user's input describes what ALREADY HAPPENED. Create the NEXT scene showing what comes AFTER:
1. Show the CONSEQUENCE or AFTERMATH of the user's action/words — not the action itself. If the user expresses an INTENTION or DESIRE (e.g., "I should ask her out", "I need to escape"), treat it as the character ACTING on it — advance to the attempt or result, don't show more hesitation
2. Skip intermediate steps — jump to the interesting result. EXCEPTION: For physical comedy and slapstick moments, use an automatic panel to SHOW the action/attempt, then an interactive panel for the aftermath — the failed attempt IS the funny part.
3. Make the scene visually distinct from the previous panel
4. Provide exactly ONE element for the user to fill in (speech, thought, or narration)
5. The world should react to the character — add consequences, surprises, or new details
6. The user controls ONLY the main character — interactive elements must be the main character's speech/thought, or narration. Other characters may only speak in automatic panels with short pre-filled text.
7. CRITICAL: Characters must ALWAYS match their blueprint descriptions. Never change a character's species, appearance, or core traits. A giraffe stays a giraffe. A panda stays a panda. Always use the exact species and descriptions provided above.
