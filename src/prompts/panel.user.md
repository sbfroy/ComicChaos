MAIN CHARACTER: {main_character}

STORY SO FAR: {rolling_summary}

{story_goals}

{recent_panels}

USER'S INPUT FROM PREVIOUS PANEL: {user_input}

The user's input describes what ALREADY HAPPENED. Create the NEXT scene showing what comes AFTER:
1. Show the CONSEQUENCE or AFTERMATH of the user's action/words — not the action itself
2. Skip intermediate steps — jump to the interesting result
3. Make the scene visually distinct from the previous panel
4. Provide exactly ONE element for the user to fill in (speech, thought, or narration)
5. The world should react to the character — add consequences, surprises, or new details
