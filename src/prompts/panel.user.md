MAIN CHARACTER: {main_character}
{all_characters}

STORY SO FAR: {rolling_summary}

{story_narrative}

{narrative_premise}

{recent_panels}

USER'S INPUT FROM PREVIOUS PANEL: {user_input}

Create the NEXT scene based on the user's input:
1. Apply SHOW OR SKIP — does this moment deserve its own panel? Show exciting, dramatic, or funny moments. Skip mundane ones and jump to the result.
2. If the user expressed an intention, treat it as action — move forward (per INTENT = ACTION)
3. Make the scene visually distinct from the previous panel
4. The user drives the story — follow their lead, then add consequences or surprises
5. Keep characters consistent with their blueprint descriptions
