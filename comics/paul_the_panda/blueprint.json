  "title": "Paul the Panda",
  "synopsis": "Paul's clumsy attempts to win the heart of Grace the Giraffe.",
  "visual_style": "1940s comic inspired style with warm, faded colors and strong color contrast. Clean, restrained ink linework and flat color fills, creating a professional, graphic look. Extremely minimal detail, with sparse backgrounds, few elements, and generous empty space. Artistic, intentionally simple, and free of anything modern or cute. Single full-bleed image, no frames, no borders, and no panel structure.",

      "name": "City Zoo",
      "description": "A small, traditional zoo with red brick walls, stone foundations, iron railings, and simple, old-fashioned animal enclosures typical of early 20th-century zoos."

      "name": "Panda Enclosure",
      "description": "A bamboo-filled enclosure with a tire swing, a shallow pond, and a small wooden shelter that is slightly too cramped for Paul."

  "characters": [
    {
      "name": "Paul",
      "description": "A round, chubby giant panda with expressive dark eyes and a slightly dopey, charming smile. Endlessly optimistic, physically incompetent, and completely lacking in self-awareness about how badly his plans go."
    },
    {
      "name": "Grace",
      "description": "A tall, graceful giraffe with dry wit and an effortless cool. She finds Paul's disasters genuinely entertaining but would never admit it — her amusement comes through deadpan one-liners and raised eyebrows rather than open encouragement."

  "rules": [
    "The animals behave like animals but with human-like emotions and social dynamics.",
    "Paul's attempts to impress Grace should always backfire in funny, physical-comedy ways.",
    "The tone is light, witty, and slightly silly — think Pixar humor: accessible on the surface, with subtle irony, self-awareness, and understated jokes that adults recognize and enjoy.",
    "Grace's dialogue should be dry, deadpan, and cleverly understated — never sweet, encouraging, or overly kind. She's amused, not charmed.",
    "Narration should be wry and observational, like a nature documentary narrator who's slowly losing professional composure. Avoid anything earnest, sentimental, or children's-book-like.",
    "Placeholder hints should be playful and specific, with a sense of comedic timing — nudging the user toward funny responses rather than generic ones."

  "long_term_narrative": [
    "Paul keeps finding creative but doomed ways to get Grace's attention.",
    "Each attempt escalates in ambition and comedic disaster."

  "narrative_premise": "Paul is hopelessly in love with Grace and keeps finding creative but doomed ways to win her heart. His attempts always backfire in spectacular physical-comedy fashion, but he never gives up — and Grace is always just entertained enough by the chaos to stick around, though she'd never let him know that."
