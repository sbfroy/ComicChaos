  "synopsis": "En klumsete innbruddstyv sine stadig mer absurde fors\u00f8k p\u00e5 \u00e5 flykte fra politiet etter et bankran som gikk galt.",
  "visual_style": "Golden-age (1940s-1950s) printed comic look: bold black ink outlines, simplified shapes, heavy blacks, and flat CMYK-style color fills. Limited warm palette with faded primaries (red/yellow/blue) plus occasional teal/green, using strong color contrast between large flat areas. Visible newsprint texture, Ben-Day/halftone dot shading, slight ink bleed, and subtle off-register printing. Hand-lettered typography with classic speech balloons and occasional starburst sound effects and speed lines. Extremely minimal detail with sparse backgrounds and generous negative space. Full-bleed composition, no borders, frames, or panel lines. No modern design language, no glossy 3D, no cute/anime styling.",

      "description": "A scrawny burglar in a black-and-white striped shirt, dark beanie, and a domino mask. Has a friendly, goofy face with big eyes and a gap-toothed grin. Looks like a classic cartoon crook \u2014 lovable but clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed."
