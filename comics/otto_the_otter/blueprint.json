  "visual_style": "Visually colorful yet softly faded, using a limited mid-20th-century color palette. Flat colors, minimal shading, clean and confident line work, and very little detail. Backgrounds are suggestive rather than descriptive, creating a calm, artistic, and pleasant atmosphere. Traditional hand-drawn look with a single full-bleed image, no frames, no borders, and no panel structure.",
